## What's this?

A small project built using [@adobe/aem-core-cif-react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/aem-core-cif-react-components). It currently shows only the My Account dropdown and the Minicart side-panel.

## But why?

Showcase the use of `@adobe/aem-core-cif-react-components` outside the traditional [Venia Demo](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-guides-venia)

## How can I run it

Make sure you have a Magento instance or a proxy to a Magento instance running on port 3002 on `localhost`

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn && yarn start`
3. Done

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
